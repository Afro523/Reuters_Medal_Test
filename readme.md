# MedalsWidget!

##Introduction
This is my attempt at the MedalsWidget test.  I used webpack for my bundling, development, and translation needs.  Just follow the documentation and it should explain everything in the App.

I decided not to use any extra libs in this project becuase it felt right making it by hand.  Normally for other projects such as my [app](https://github.com/Afro523/MineralID-Meteor "app") I have used [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/ "Material UI") for a quicker development.

Enjoy!
##Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Afro523/Reuters_Medal_Test.git
cd Reuters_Medal_Test
npm install
npm start
```
Navigate to http://localhost:8080/

## Use
Aside from using the app in the browser you can also change the intial input values.

Now that the server is running, if you open up the root folder in your favorite text-editor you can change the initial input in dist/index.html.
